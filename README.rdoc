== Subwayz

Subwayz is an application for the average New Yorker who may want to retrieve the status of the subway train they intend to take as a part of their daily commute. 
Unsatisfied with the unreliability of the current information available about train arrivals, our group has decided to provide the average commuter with supplementary information. 
This will be done by gathering information via crowdsourcing, as we believe that other fellow commuters will be a more reliable source of information.

For detail info, please read the requirement statement from the following link:
